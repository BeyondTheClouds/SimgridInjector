TODO: 

July 3, 2014,   Fix simgrid_full.jar issue (currently not include to the git repo)

June 30, 2014,  Relocate VMs to other nodes (randomly) when a node crash (turnOff is invoked by the injector)

June 30, 2014   Add network stress (in/out)


Oct.28, 2012	MB_MIG is not per node but per scheduling/reconfiguration process.
				It would be good to know exactly which PMs are really involved in the reconfiguration
				process (for both the centralized version and the DVMS one).
				This implies to analyze the reconfiguration plan from Entropy2RP
				(note: in the two files: i.e.for centralized version and the DVMS one :()

June 20, 2012	There is a bug (or a feature ;)) in node.isOverloaded() from DVMSNode:
					 this.getCPUUsedByVMs() > DVMSProperties.getCPUOverloadThreshold()
					 defaultThreShold is a percentage where CPUsedByVMs is not a percentage but
					like it is defined in simulation.properties (note that default threshold is
					declare in dvms.properties)

June 12, 2012	Add a generic way to enable (or disabled) the traces and to specify the trace file		Adrien/Flavien - Done Nov. 12, 2012
				=> Resolve log (i.e.logback) issue. Actually, Entropy is leveraging sfl4j:
				a wrapper for logger utilities (log4j, logback, jdj14,....).
				By default, slf4j tries to bind itself with one (and ONLY one) logging utilities.
				1./if there are more than one binding possibility, slf4j does not succeed to bind correctly
				and no messages will be logged => let only ONE binding (i.e.either slf4j or logback for instance)
				2./ Once you are sure that slf4j is bound to only one logging system, apply the corresponding
				configuration process.
				For logback, a logback.xml file should be placed in the classpath (in our case, placing such a
				file in the correct location was not sufficient. We have to set the logback system properties
				by adding -Dlogback.configurationFile=config/logback.xml as one of the VM arguments.

June 12, 2012	Add a counter per VM to know how many times the CPU has changed ?

June 12, 2012   Add a generic way to start different sizes of instances (cf . python scripts) 			Adrien - Done June 12, 2012

June 6, 2012	the injector should lead to underloaded situation not only normal or underloaded        Adrien - Done June 30, 2014

May 25, 2012	Validate the distribution model (it seems there are too many events)					Adrien - Validated by Lionel June 12, 2012

May 25, 2012	Trace Simgrid 																			Adrien - Done June 6, 2012

May 25, 2012	Pthread limitation (see if we can know the maximum phtread number according to the OS). Adrien/Jonathan - Switch on Davinci JVM and take advantage of the coroutines Oct 25, 2012

May 4, 2012		Update current configuration after performing a reconfiguration							Adrien - Done May 23, 2012

May 3, 2012		Automatically generate platform and deployment files 									Adrien - Done May 25, 2012, see ./generate.py at the root of the project
